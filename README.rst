Foxbunny's vimfiles
===================

After a long while, I got around to cleaning up my vim configuration. Removed
all the stuff I don't need, updated all bundles, etc. Since it sucks to keep
files in sync between machines, I'm putting it up here.

The following is included:

- Pathogen
- Sensible
- NERDTree
- CtrlP
- Fugitive
- Gundo
- Mako bundle
- Color sampler pack 2012
- python-indent
- python-syntax
- syntastic
- lightline
- vim-javascript
- vim-jsx
- html5.vim

The configuration covers the following languages:

- Python
- SASS/SCSS
- Mako templates
- CoffeeScript
- JavaScript and JSX
- HTML5
- Shell scripts
